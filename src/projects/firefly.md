### Project description:
We aimed to explore the organization of autonomous, self-sustaining organisms. Inspired by the phenomenon of firefly synchronization, we wanted to create simple firefly units capable of living in a community and reproducing this behavior. Each firefly is equipped with a light source, an internal timer, a small speaker, and a means of communication with other fireflies through IR transmission. The firefly is designed to communicate with others that may be present in the field in any arbitrary topography. They interact with each other and are capable of complete synchronization, while also enabling mutual data transmission that can be seen, heard, and configured.

The synchronization phenomenon in nature:
